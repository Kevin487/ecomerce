The Democratic party, of the 117th congress of America, wants to pass a three to four trillion dollar stimulus package by the end of January or early February. The only problem lies within the senate because the house and the white house are fully controlled by the Democratic Party. The senate needs to give 60 votes for the bill to pass, but only 51 if the Recon Process is used, which can only be used by the controlling party nine times within the two years.

The ability to call forth the recon process means that a split vote of 50 to 50 will be resolved by the vice president Kamala Haris. Democrats have a lot of power to pass legislation, but only if they remain united. Therefore, negotiations may be present to win a few democrats or republicans because every senator stands on different places within the democratic and republican scale.

This bill is an infrastructure package, with a tax bill written on top of it. There will be tax hikes for capital gains and infrastructure development projects to reach a society that is carbon neutral by 2050.

The stimulus package can be expected to give the majority of the population, within America, the benefits of wealth. Joe Biden has mentioned that he does not want to experiment with trickle down economic policies, but implement trickle up economic action.
